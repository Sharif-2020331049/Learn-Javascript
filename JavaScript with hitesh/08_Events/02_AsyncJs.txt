1. JS default characteristics: 
     i. JS Synchronous: Executes one line of code at a time in sequence.
     ii. Single Threaded: JavaScript operates in a single-threaded environment,
           meaning it can only perform one task at a time.

2. Execution Context:
   i. Executes one line of code at a time.
   ii. The Call Stack and Memory Heap are parts of the execution context.
       The call stack keeps track of function calls, while the memory heap is used for memory allocation.          

3. Blocking Code: Blocks the flow of the program until the operation completes.

4. Non-Blocking Code: Does not block execution and allows other operations to run concurrently.

5. JavaScript Engine and Event Loop: 

   i. JavaScript Engine Components: 
       -Memory Heap: Stores variables and objects.
       -Call Stack: Manages function calls and execution contexts.

   ii. Web APIs and Asynchronous Execution:     
     - Web API: External APIs provided by the browser (e.g., DOM API, setTimeout, setInterval, fetch).
     -Functions like setTimeout, setInterval, and fetch are handled by Web APIs and 
       return control to the JavaScript engine.  
     -Callbacks: Registered in Web APIs and pushed to the callback queue after execution.

   iii.  Event Loop:
      -The event loop continuously checks the call stack and the task queue.
      -When the call stack is empty, the event loop pushes tasks from the task queue to the call stack.
